# HR Connect - Comprehensive HR Management System

## Project Overview
HR Connect is a comprehensive HR management system built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and Drizzle ORM. It provides complete employee lifecycle management, attendance tracking, leave management, and payroll features.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend (Replit dev)**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Backend (IIS production)**: Core PHP 8.0+ with MySQL — see `php-backend/`
- **Database (dev)**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database (production)**: MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control

## PHP Backend for SpeedCloud IIS (`php-backend/`)
Complete PHP 8.0+ backend for deployment on Windows IIS (SpeedCloud):
- `php-backend/index.php` — Front-controller router (entry point for all `/api/*`)
- `php-backend/config/database.php` — MySQL PDO connection, SMTP, APP_BASE_URL constants
- `php-backend/schema.sql` — Complete MySQL schema with default admin user
- `php-backend/setup.php` — First-time setup script (import schema + create admin; delete after use)
- `php-backend/web.config` — IIS URL Rewrite rules (SPA fallback + API routing)
- `php-backend/helpers/Auth.php` — Session-based auth, bcrypt password hashing
- `php-backend/helpers/Response.php` — JSON response helpers
- `php-backend/helpers/Mail.php` — SMTP email helper (replaces SendGrid)
- `php-backend/controllers/` — All controllers: Auth, Employee, Department, Attendance, Leave, Holiday, Notification, Payroll, Report, Master, Settings
- `php-backend/build-iis-package.sh` — Build script to create deployment zip
- `php-backend/README-iis-deploy.md` — Full IIS deployment guide

### IIS Deployment Steps
1. `npm run build` → creates `dist/`
2. `bash php-backend/build-iis-package.sh` → creates `hrconnect-iis-deploy.zip`
3. Upload zip to SpeedCloud web root and extract
4. Configure env vars (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, SESSION_SECRET, SMTP_*)
5. Visit `https://yourdomain.com/api/setup.php` → imports schema, creates admin
6. Delete `api/setup.php` immediately after
7. Login: admin / Admin@1234 (change immediately)

## Deployment

### Replit Deployment
- **Target**: Autoscale deployment configured
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start`

### cPanel Subdirectory Deployment (/hrms)
The app is fully configured to work at `cybaemtech.net/hrms`.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Build the app locally**: `npm run build`
   - Creates `dist/` folder with:
     - `dist/index.html` - React app entry point
     - `dist/assets/` - CSS and JavaScript bundles
     - `dist/images/` - Static images
     - `dist/index.js` - Node.js backend server

2. **Choose your hosting method:**

   **Option A: Backend & Frontend on Same cPanel Server**
   - Upload entire `dist/` folder to `/home/yourdomain/public_html/hrms/`
   - Create Node.js application in cPanel Passenger pointing to `/hrms/index.js`
   - Set environment variable: `APP_BASE_PATH=/hrms`
   - Access at: `cybaemtech.net/hrms`

   **Option B: Frontend on cPanel, Backend on Separate VPS**
   - Before building, set environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE=https://your-api-domain.com`
   - Run `npm run build` (rebuilds with API pointing to your VPS)
   - Upload only `dist/index.html`, `dist/assets/`, and `dist/images/` to `public_html/hrms/`
   - Run backend Node.js server on your VPS
   - Access frontend at: `cybaemtech.net/hrms`
   - Backend API handles requests at: `https://your-api-domain.com/api/*`

**Important Notes**:
- The app uses in-memory storage by default (data resets on server restart). For production, switch to PostgreSQL.
- All frontend routes are automatically relative to `/hrms` base path
- API requests automatically route through the configured VITE_API_BASE
- Test users: admin/admin123, hr/hr123, manager/manager123, employee/employee123
